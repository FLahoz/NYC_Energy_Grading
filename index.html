    <p>
      On December 15th, New York City officials voted to pass Intro 2317, which ensured NYC would become the largest metropolitan city to promise fossil fuel independence. The legislation ensures that building permits for 2027 would need clean alternatives for heating, hot water and cooking, with certain exceptions for hospitals and commercial kitchens.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Legislation only affects new construction projects. Current buildings wouldn't need to hold to these new guidelines. Below is a map of NYC's community districts and the average energy ratings for buildings in the area. Energy STAR ratings are based on a national survey of buildings based on a number of key factors. A rating of 100 being the most efficient building.

    <p>
      The data presented here shows the area with the most energy efficient buildings, southern Staten Island, also have the most recent construction. According to data from the <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/22c7182a162d45788dd52a2362f8ed65">CDC</a>, this area also has some of the lowest rates of asthma. The city hopes that this new legislation will not only improve the health of new yorkers, but decrease our carbon footprint.

      "It’s a historic step forward in our efforts to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” said Ben Furnas, the director of climate and sustainability for the mayor's office, in an interview with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/nyregion/nyc-gas-stove-heat-ban.html">NY Times</a>.
